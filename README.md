*Project Title:* Virtual Stuy
*Members:* Oliver Ball, Helen Nie, David Kurkovskiy, Shreya Kalva

*Description:* This is a map guide to the building of Stuyvesant and possibly the immediate surroundings. The map will include all ten floors. Each floor will contain information such as locations of classrooms, gyms, water fountains, restrooms, etc.

The app also shows the most probable location of each teacher based on the teachers schedule. The location of students can be shown as well if the student makes the information available.

The app has a notification function that can be personalized by the user. For example, the user can ask the app to notify when person X is in room 301.
